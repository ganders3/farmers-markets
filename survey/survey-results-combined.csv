The latter made is super easy and efficient to shop! I also liked that it was generally less crowded once inside (though I hated waiting in line). The online shopping was also a nice time saver in some cases.","When capacity restrictions were in place, I still saw most people were shopping in groups/families of 2-4 people, which contributed to longer lines. It would have been nice if a 1 person/household limit were enforced or if there was a singles line to get in so solo shoppers could get some priority.","I appreciate that the Ballard market continued to run during the pandemic, so thank you!"

The convenience of a less crowded environment and quick shopping. I would prefer to wait in line at a regulated market rather than the chaos of the unregulated one. Sunday July 11 my experience at the no rules ballard famrmeed ,"NA I thought it was managed very well with the hybrid drive thru, preorder and in person. Staff and vendors were friendly and complied ",Now at 100% capacity and no masks it’s too crowded and feels unsafe. Please open a ‘shopping only’ hour say 8am for serious shoppers no casual socializing. I’ll be visiting less often this summer bc of this. Time to use grocery stores more again alas.

We love food trucks!,"At the Wallingford farmers market this week (7/14), so few of the vendors wore masks that I felt unsafe. My partner and I are vaccinated but our kids are too young for it yet, and we won't be bringing them back until more vendors are masked. The week before we patronized only vendors who were masked; this week only two vendors were masked. I can't put my children's health and safety at risk by trusting strangers to be vaccinated. My kids (4.5 and 2) are great at wearing masks but we were disappointed to see adults no longer are!!' "
